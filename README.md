# Domo is your personal AI agent on your computer

This AI agent is designed to serve as a fully private, locally running personal assistant that helps users manage and understand their digital workspace without relying on external services. Its core aim is to provide a free, secure alternative to cloud-based tools by enabling intelligent operations on local documents (such as searching for information, summarizing files or entire folders, classifying and organizing content, and ranking documents by relevance) while also augmenting its capabilities with internet-based research. By combining local data access with AI-driven reasoning, it allows users to efficiently navigate and act on their information while keeping full control over their data.

## Run

Start the app with:

```bash
./run_app.sh
```

Run the job workflow directly with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m tools.job.main
```

Process a single local job folder with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m tools.job.main data/jobs/my-job
```

Notes:

- Open the local URL shown by Streamlit, typically `http://localhost:8051`.
- This repo must be run with the local [`.venv`](/Users/z/dev/domo/domo/.venv), not a global Streamlit install.
- `./run_app.sh` uses `.venv/bin/streamlit` explicitly, which avoids `ModuleNotFoundError` from Anaconda/global Python.
- If you prefer the raw command, use `.venv/bin/streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py --server.port 8051`.
- Use the `streamlit` CLI to run the app, not `python app/streamlit_app.py`.
- Start Ollama on `http://localhost:11434` before using the assistant or the job workflow.
- `python -m tools.job.main` with no argument runs the default ATS search using `domo_config.yaml`.
- `python -m tools.job.main <folder>` accepts a folder containing either `job_description_raw.txt` or `cleaned_job_description.txt`.
- Generated artifacts are written under the configured outputs folder, which defaults to `data/outputs/`.
- Main application settings now live in `domo_config.yaml`, including paths, debug mode, Ollama settings, and job-search parameters.

## Current job workflow

- `assistant/runtime.py` plans whether to answer directly or call a tool.
- `assistant/policy.py` validates tool arguments and restricts job folder paths to the project data roots.
- `tools/job/run_job_agent.py` launches the job workflow through the project `.venv`.
- `tools/job/main.py` supports three modes:
  - no argument: search ATS sources using the parameters in `domo_config.yaml`
  - folder containing `job_description_raw.txt`: clean the raw job ad, generate a PDF, and generate application materials
  - folder containing `cleaned_job_description.txt`: skip cleaning and generate the remaining outputs from the cleaned text
- Main configuration lives in `domo_config.yaml`, including:
  - `debug.enabled`
  - `paths`
  - `ollama`
  - `job_workflow`
  - `job_search`
- Job search parameters in `domo_config.yaml` include:
  - `role`
  - `location`
  - `sources`
  - `companies`
  - `max_jobs`
  - `max_results_per_source`
  - `max_company_attempts_per_source`
- Batch search writes discovered job inputs under the configured jobs folder, which defaults to `data/jobs/`.
- Generated artifacts are written under timestamped folders in the configured outputs folder, which defaults to `data/outputs/`.
- Current generated files are:
  - `cleaned_job_description.txt`
  - `job_description.pdf`
  - `application_notes.txt`
  - `summary.txt`
  - `skills.txt`
  - `sample_cv.txt`
- The workflow can search and prepare documents, but it does not currently submit applications through portals or monitor application status.
